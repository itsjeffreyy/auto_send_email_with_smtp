# Auto Email Sender Project
auto_send_email_with_smtp

This project contains two Python scripts, `encrypt_sender_emailinfo.py` and `auto_send_email.py`, which are used to automate the process of sending emails.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.6 or later.
- You have installed the following Python package:
  - `pycryptodome==3.20.0` for cryptographic operations or `pycrypto`

You can install this package using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## encrypt_sender_emailinfo.py
This script encrypts the senderâ€™s email address and password. The encrypted credentials are then used by the auto_send_email.py script to send the email.

```

Optional arguments:

-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT: The output file to write the encrypted credentials. (default: sender_info_encrypt.txt)
-k KEYFILE, --keyfile KEYFILE: The file to save the encryption key. (default: .key.txt)
```

## auto_send_email.py
This script sends an email with an optional attachment.

```

Optional arguments:

```bash
-h, --help: Show the help message and exit.
--subject SUBJECT: The subject of the email.
--body BODY: The body of the email.
--sender SENDER: The file containing the encrypted sender information. (default: sender_info_encrypt.txt)
